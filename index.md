# Continuous Integration

{:.no_toc}

Welcome to the RADIUSS Continuous Integration (CI) set of instructions. RADIUSS provides this documentation that is rendered from <a href="https://github.com/rse-ops/ci" target="_blank">the matching GitHub repository</a> to help you to create CI pipelines for your projects.
Explore the different build frameworks on the left to learn how to generate your
CI pipeline. If you have a framework that is not listed here, please <a href="https://github.com/rse-ops/ci/issues" target="_blank">let us know!</a>

## Supported Tooling

The following external documentation sites can additionally provide support to test RADIUSS-specific projects.

 - [RADIUSS Shared CI](https://radiuss-shared-ci.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is intended to provide open source RADIUSS projects with the ability to be hosted on GitHub, but run extra CI on LC GitLab. To use this setup you will need a spack package for your software. The Cmake build system is strongly recommended but not mandatory.
 - [MFEM GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mfem/github-actions) is a set of Github Actions to install MFEM dependencies and MFEM itself in the Github Actions context.
